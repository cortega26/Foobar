# Google Foobar

Welcome to the Google Foobar repository! This is a place for you to showcase my solutions to the challenges presented through the Google Foobar program.

## What is Google Foobar?

Google Foobar is a secret recruiting program run by Google for software engineering talent. It involves a series of coding challenges that are designed to test your skills and abilities as a software engineer.

## How do I get invited to Google Foobar?

Invitation to Google Foobar is typically extended to individuals who have demonstrated exceptional programming ability through their past work or by solving difficult coding challenges online. It is not something that can be applied for or signed up for. I got an invitation after finishing the Coursera Google Data Analytics course.

## What can I find in this repository?

In this repository, you will find the solutions to the challenges presented to you through the Google Foobar program. Each challenge will have its own directory, containing the prompt, any relevant files, and the solution code.

## How do I contribute to this repository?

If you have been invited to participate in the Google Foobar program and have solved one or more of the challenges, we welcome you to contribute your solutions to this repository. To do so, please follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Create a new directory for your challenge solution, using the format `challenge-X`, where `X` is the number of the challenge.
4. Add the prompt and any relevant files for the challenge to the new directory.
5. Add your solution code to the new directory.
