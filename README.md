# Google Foobar

Welcome to the Google Foobar repository! Here you can find my solutions to the coding challenges presented by Google Foobar.

## What is Google Foobar?

Google Foobar is a secret recruitment program for talented software engineers. It consists of a series of coding challenges designed to test your skills and abilities.

## How can I get invited to Google Foobar?

Invitations to Google Foobar are typically extended to individuals who have demonstrated exceptional programming ability through their past work or by solving difficult coding challenges online. It is not something that can be applied for or signed up for. I received an invitation after completing the Coursera Google Data Analytics course.
